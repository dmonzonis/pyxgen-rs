# pyxgen-rs
This is a port of [the original pyxgen](https://github.com/dmonzonis/pyxgen) in Rust.

This project was only created for me to learn some Rust, so it probably does not offer any advantage over the original project
made with Python, and since I am still in the process of learning Rust, the code may be inefficient and not idiomatic.
You have been warned.
